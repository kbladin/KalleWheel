General

stdlib.js
  This file is probably the single most useful script in the toolkit. Every
  time I write a new piece of functionality, it usually finds a home here.
  A whole gamut of functions are found in here for working with:
        - Actions
        - Files
        - Selections
        - Layers
        - Containers
        - Paths
        - Batch
        - Colors
        - Patterns
        - Guides

PSConstants.js
  This perl-generated script provides more readable names for IDs used in PS
  ScriptListener output. For instance, instead of this:

    var ref5 = new ActionReference();
    var id22 = charIDToTypeID("Mn  ");
    var id23 = charIDToTypeID("MnIt");
    var id24 = charIDToTypeID("FrTr");
    ref5.putEnumerated(id22, id23, id24);

  you can write this:

    var ref = new ActionReference();
    ref.putEnumerated(PSClass.MenuItem, PSType.MenuItem, PSEnum.FreeTransform);

  Other handy routines for doing reverse lookups are also available.

Action.js
  Base definitions for all Action related classes.

ActionRunner.js
  Makes it possible to read in an ActionFile or ActionXMLFile from disk and
  execute it without loading it into the ActionsPalette. This allows you to
  write scripts that call an action that call a script.

ActionSelector.jsx
  This script provides UIs for selection actions from the runtime palette and
  actions from an action file.

BatchProcessor.js
  This is a rudimentary batch processor class for hierarchies of images.

ColorBook.js
  ColorBook/Color Palette file can be read with this script.

Getter.jsx
        This script accesses just everything that can be reached from the
        Javascript API. This includes:
                - Application Info
                    (Preferences, PresetManager Info, Fonts, etc...)
                for each open document
                  - Document Info
                  - Background Info
                  - Layer Info
                  - Channel Info
                  - Path Info
                  - History Info

        If you can get information you want from the Javascript API, take a
        look at the output of this script. This has everything you can get to,
        although you do have to go through the ActionDescriptor API to get at
        it.
exec.js
  This is some template code for executing external applications from
  Javascript using either .bat files or bash scripts. Provisions are made for
  passing arguments to applications and capturing output.

JShell.js
  This is the way-cool Javascript shell implementation for Photoshop.

JSLog.js
LogWindow.js
  These scripts provide some handy logging capabilities. Output can be logged
  to file, to the debugger, or to a dialog.

Levels.js
  Some interesting ways of auto-leveling code. The big add-on is the ability
to trim tails from the histogram.

ResizeImage.js
  A set of different mechanisms of resizing code beyond simply calling
Document.resizeImage.

SaveAs.js
  A collection of save-as methods for different image file types.

SmartSharpen.jsx
  Defines a SmartSharpenOptions object and a function that utilizes it.

Stream.js
  This is how you do binary file IO in Javascript in Photoshop.

TextProcessor.js
  This handy little class provides a framework for processing text files
  perl-style. It calls a callback function/method for each line in the file.
  Flatten.js is a good example of real-world usage.


My Workflow scripts

Conf.js
  An attempt at providing a way of dealing with having to run a script in
multiple versions of Photoshop.

metadata.js
  A template for futzing around with metadata.

NormalizeArt.js
  Convert a scanned art image into something I can work with.

NormalizeDocument.js
  Convert digital photo into something I can work with.

Options.js
  Code for handling options on disk.
 
Service.js
  Framework code that hides the source of the document from a script that just
wants to process the document.

Watermark.js
  A script for adding watermarks to a document.


Other Bits

PatternFile.js
ShapesFile.js
StylesFile.js
ToolPresetsFile.js
  Scripts for reading various Presets files for names and ids. Not
  yet complete.

json.js
  An external script for handling basic Javascript object serialization and
  deserialization. Options.js will be upgraded to use this in the future. More
  information on this script can be found at http://JSON.org
