atn2bin.jsx
  The code in this file handles the conversion between binary Actions (e.g.
  from the disk) and Action.js/ActionManager data structures in JS. It does not
  do code generation. That will come in a later release in a differnt file.
  But you can take ActionDescriptors created in ScriptListener code and use
  them to construct actions that you can save to a .atn file or run directly
  with ActionRunner.

atn2xml.jsx
  This script does the conversion between Action.js/ActionManager data
  structures and XML. The XML can either be accessed via sax or dom apis or
  converted to a string, stored to file, and or modified. With the code in
  atn2bin.jsx, you now have the ability to convert Actions to XML, modify the
  XML and then regenerate the Action file.

atn2js.jsx
  Translates Action Files to Javascript code. The code generated is readable
  and reusabe.

atn2bin-test.jsx
atn2xml-test.jsx
atntest.js
  This is a bunch of code for testing atn2bin and atn2xml. I'm not sure how
  much of this actually works anymore.

xmlsax.js
xmlw3cdom.js
xmlpath.js
  These are a set of files from the project at http://xmljs.sourceforge.net
  that are used for XML stuff (Duh!).
